# Raspberry-Wall
Raspberry Wall is a implementation of a message-board/post-wall allowing to display short messages, images and videos on a screen, scroll through them, display the images and play the videos in full-screen. It queries an specified mailbox for particular messages, extract the text and display valid attachments. It works as an digital picture/video frame after some idle timeout.
